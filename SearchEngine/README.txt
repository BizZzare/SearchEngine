The project is developed for searching both in the Web and Database. 

When you first run the solution, you see the field where you should enter your query and two buttons: Search and a button that redirects you to the database search page. So, if you entered a query and pressed search button you should see the first 10 results that returned eather Google.com or Bing.com (depending on which of the responces we got earlier). 

If you click on DataBase search button, you will be redirected to the page with the same form but on that page you can get results of searching among the saved in our db results.

Hope you'll enjoy :)
